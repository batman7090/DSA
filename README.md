# 🧠 DSA Practice

Welcome to my repository for practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**! This project is a personal initiative to strengthen my problem-solving skills, enhance coding efficiency, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 About

This repository contains my daily or weekly attempts at solving DSA problems from various platforms like:

- LeetCode
- HackerRank

I solve problems using multiple data structures and algorithmic techniques, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## 🚀 Goals

- Master core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.)
- Understand and apply key algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.)
- Improve time and space complexity analysis skills
- Prepare for technical interviews

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
